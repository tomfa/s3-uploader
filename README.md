# s3-uploader

> Browser based S3 file upload, using signed upload tokens.

Demo at https://tomfa.github.io/s3-uploader

----

Code in this repository can be used as a basis for implementing direct S3 upload for your website users, by providing them with a one-time upload token. 

In this repository, aws secret and access keys are provided through the UI. For a production service, your keys should be stored on server, not in client. `src/lib/aws/auth.js` contains most of the logic that should then be moved.
